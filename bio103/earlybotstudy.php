<h2>a. Early Botanical Study</h2>
<p class="smallWords">It started as a practical study centered upon the importance of plants in human life as sources of food for nourishment, of fibers for clothing, of drugs for treatment of human diseases and of fuel. The study advanced to an intellectual interest such as satisfying curiosity about the world where human beings live. Then, man began seeking answers to questions such as. how are plants constructed; how are they nourished; and how do they grow and reproduce.</p>

<p class="smallWords">The study continued and became a science when facts were intelligently and logically organized. The steps in the scientific method: observing, hypothesizing, experimenting, predicting and concluding lead to   theorizing and making a natural law. It was only then, when the existence of natural laws was demonstrated and accurate prediction of effects from a given set of causes was-made.</p>

	i. The early branches of Botany and the persons that were identified with them :<br /><br />
	1) <em>Plant Taxonomy</em> - the study of plant classification and relationship - Carolus Linneaus<br /><br />
	2) <em>Plant Morphology</em> - the study of the plant structures {finer details and gross morphology}-(this required little technical apparatus and the chief prerequisites were patience and painstaking observation and description). <br /><br />
		 a) <em>Plant Anatomy</em> - the study of the finer details of plant tissue and cell structure - Nehemiah Grew, Robert Hooke, Marcelo Malpighi
         b) <em>Plant Cytology</em> - the microscopic study of plant cell structure and behavior- Robert Hooke<br /><br />
	3) <em>Plant Physiology</em> - the study of the plant’s functional processes or any of its parts - John Ray, Von Helmont, Stephen Hales<br /><br />
	4) <em>Plant Genetics</em> - the study of plant’s inheritance and variation-Gregor Mendel, Charles Darwin<br /><br />
	5) <em>Plant Ecology</em> - the study of the relation of plants to their environmental conditions that affect their distribution and abundance<br /><br />
	6) <em>Plant Pathology</em> - the study of plant’s diseases and their control. -E. Southworth -Spaulding
