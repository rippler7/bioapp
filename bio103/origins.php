		theorized the chemical evolution theory which states that conditions on earth were quite different when living systems were being formed. Atmosphere very likely may contain little oxygen, rich in ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. Organic compounds from which contemporary life is built were produced by the energy of sunlight, electrical discharge, and volcanic heat acting on these components of the primitive atmosphere. This is  known as coacervate theory. This idea was conceptualized based on the clay pot theory. Sydney Fox (1912-1998) theorized the clay pot theory. It states that low concentrations of organic molecules in the soupy seas are pushed onto the shore into basins of water where the water is evaporated by heat. What is left is the high concentration of organic molecules, cell like structure called proteinoid microspheres.</li>

		In support of these views, in 1953, 30 years after the Oparin’s view was known, Stanley Miller (1930-2007) subjected four gases: hydrogen, methane, ammonia and water vapour to the energy of an electric spark and circulated the mixture in a closed system. He succeeded in producing several organic compounds including amino acids (nitrogen containing organic building blocks of proteins) put forth the theory of abiogenesis. However, neither purines and pyrimidines (essential constituents of the building blocks of proteins) nor other heterocyclic/aromatic compounds were formed. Certain conditions must be met in order for chemically complex entities to be formed.

		Vitalists have looked forward to the day when science may actually create a “living” thing from simple chemicals.  They claim that rightly so, that even if such a man-made life form could be created, this would not prove that natural life forms may have  developed by a similar chemical evolutionary process. The scientists understand this and plod on testing theories.
